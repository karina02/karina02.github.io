    <p>When I was smaller, my dream was to be a designer of some sort. To be able to make something completely different from others. My first thought was to be a fashion designer because I used to love coming up with a structure of clothes that would look fashionable, but my dream started to evolve when I discovered architecture and the beauty of designing a whole building. I plan to go to a college called Woodbury College that specializes with students who also desire pursuing architecture. I have chosen to make this my goal because it is fun to draw my own designs. I love the idea of creating something original</p>
    <p>I believe with my fast learning skills, I can quickly learn how to precisely design anything. I consider this one of my greatest strength because it helps me develop an idea which helps better my knowledge. An amazing achievement I accomplished was when I was able to complete a project with my group, we had to complete a type of machine that functions by only touching it once. This an amazing accomplishment for me because it was one of the greatest time I showed my skills. From my experiences, I’ve learned that making mistakes are ok to make, as long as I come back trying even harder. </p>
    <p>I am grateful for the experiences I’ve had, and I wish the continue learning more to expand my knowledge for my career and life choices. Thank you for reading.</p>
